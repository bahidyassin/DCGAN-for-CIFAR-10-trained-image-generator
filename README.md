# DCGAN for CIFAR-10 trained image generator:

#### Yassin Bahid

DCGAN is a type of GAN that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for both the generator and discriminator, making it an effective model for image generation. We train a DCGAN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate the quality of the generated images. Our results demonstrate that DCGAN is capable of generating high-quality images with good diversity and can learn from small datasets. However, we also note that DCGAN can be difficult to train and sensitive to hyperparameters. DCGAN is a promising model for image generation tasks on CIFAR-10 and other similar datasets.
